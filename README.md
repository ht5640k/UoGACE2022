## **About the Project**

This project has been developed by the contributors below as a submission of coursework for the University of Greenwich Advanced Computer Engineering Module, academic year 2021/22.

The Machine Vision Foam Dart Turret is a fully automated object targetting system designed to identify, target, and shoot (with a foam dart to two) a person not recognised by the machine vision. It features a 12 dart magazine, 2 axis movement, a Jetson Nano controlled vision system, and two interfaces (one for LAN based web control and video feedback, and one for automatic downloading of this GitHub repo).

Mechanical parts of this project are mostly custom using standard industry parts for difficult to manufacture parts such as stepper motors and bearings. The software is written mostly from scratch, using part libraries where sensible, particularily for the arduino interfacing with hardware, and the Jetson managing its machine vision identification.

## **Firing Mechanism Mechanical Design** - [Chris Halsall - ch6941r](https://www.github.com/ch6941r)

The firing mechanism contains a few pre-made parts including a small stepper motor, the firing motors and barrel, a servo, and a bearing. All other parts have been designed in Fusion 360 and printed in orange PLA on an Ender 3 FDM 3D printer. It features a 12 dart rotary magazine driven by the stepper motor from one end and supported by a bearing at the other end. Through the bearing is mounted a magnet and a magnetic position sensor so that the control electronics can measure the angle of the magazine. A servo is mounted in the base and, with a custom arm, is capable of pushing a dart from the magazine into the firing motors and thus propelling it out of the barrel. A mounting plate is attached to the front of the design to securely mount the camera for machine vision. Finally, a hole and hex slot has been designed in to allow for easy mounting to the pan/tilt mehcanism.

The control electoronics includes an A4988 stepper driver, current limited to 0.5A per phase, an I2C connection for the magnetic position sensor, and a MOSFET (and protection circuitry) for driving the firing motors. These all interface with the joint Arduino Nano that controls all aspects of the moveable mech.

## **Pan-Tilt Mechanism Mechanical Design** - [Andrew Dean - ad4646d](https://www.github.com/ad4646d)

The [pan-tilt mechanism](https://github.com/vinthund/UoGACE2022/tree/main/Pan-TiltAssembly) is a bespoke 3D printed mechanism that was designed in tandem with bespoke the [firing mechanism](https://github.com/vinthund/UoGACE2022/tree/ad4646d/3D%20Designs/Firing%20Mech) using AutoDesk Fusion 360.

***{insert up-to-date photo}***

Herringbone gears were chosen for both pan and tilt axes for a number of reasons:
* They feature minimal backlash compared to 3D printed spur gears
* They are quieter in operation compared to 3D printed spur gears
* More torque can be transmitted through them vs 3D printed spur gears\

A gearing ratio of 4:1 was chosen to increase the torque output of the NEMA17 steppers and to give greater step-angle resolution... ***add further calculations for speed and torque output***.

All bespoke 3D printed parts for the pan-tilt mechanism were printed in black PLA using an Anycubic i3 Mega.

An [off-the-shelf electronics enclosure](https://www.screwfix.com/p/schneider-electric-ip66-weatherproof-outdoor-enclosure-164-x-105-x-192mm/) was chosen to be the base of the system, this particular enclosure was chosen as it would provide adequate space to house all system components.

A [lazy susan bearing](https://www.stilesandbates.co.uk/75mm-square-lazy-susan-bearing-1709.php) was chosen for the pan axis as it allowed for a convenient way to manage cables between the combined pan-tilt/firing mech and their control electronics in the enclosure below.

The full parts list for the pan-tilt mechanism can be found [here](https://github.com/vinthund/UoGACE2022/blob/ad4646d/Pan-TiltAssembly/Documentation/Pan-Tilt%20Head%20Parts%20List.pdf).\

**Pan/Tilt Mechanism Hardware - [Andrew Dean - ad4646d](https://www.github.com/ad4646d)**

NEMA17 stepper motors were chosen for the Pan/Tilt axis as they provided adequate torque output to move both axes, they also feature a step angle of 1.8Ëš.
* A [NEMA17x34](https://www.omc-stepperonline.com/nema-17-bipolar-1-8deg-26ncm-36-8oz-in-0-4a-12v-42x42x34mm-4-wires.html?search=17hs13) was chosen for the tilt axis
* A [NEMA17x39](https://www.omc-stepperonline.com/nema-17-bipolar-45ncm-6374ozin-15a-42x42x39mm-4-wires-w--1m-pin-connector.html?search=17HS15-1504S-X1&description=true) was chosen for the pan axis

[A4988 stepper drivers](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B07MXXL2KW) were selected for a number of reasons:
* They can drive bi-polar stepper motors up to 2A/phase
* They only require two control pins from the microcontroller to control steps and direction
* They are still readily available amidst the current global component shortage

A combination of [small neodymium magnets](https://www.first4magnets.com/circular-disc-rod-c34/2mm-dia-x-2mm-thick-n42sh-neodymium-magnet-0-15kg-pull-p3327#ps_0_3379|ps_1_16690) and [hall effect sensors](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B08QCRYXPK) are used to both 'home' each axis and to and to limit the movement on the tilt axis, these were chosen over limit switches as they simplified mechanical assembly and design.

The hardware was connected up on a breadboard for testing ahead of the design of a veroboard prototype control board.

## **Movement Control Circuitry** - [Chris Halsall - ch6941r](https://www.github.com/ch6941r)

A custom circuit board has been designed and built to accomodate the requirements for electrical control. A limitations prevented the use of a custom designed PCB including time, budget, and that continuous development was required therefore dynamically changing the structure of the circuit. A stripboard was chosen as it is relatively versatile and can accomodate throughhole components with ease. 

The bottom of the board is dedicated to power rails, 0V and 12V from an external PSU, and 5V generated by an L7805 linear regulator with the 12V input. All other board components are spread evenly to attempt to seperate wiring connectors as much as possible. The component parts are 
* Arduino Nano
* 3x A4988 stepper motor drivers
* 6x Hall effect sensor headers
* 1x Servo header
* 1x I2C header
* 1x MOSFET, flyback diode, and associated motor header

Some additional capacitors and a diode help to reduce input shock current (and therefore prevent brownout) and reverse power connection damage.

## **Firing Mechanism Communications** - [JoelSmalls](https://www.github.com/JoelSmalls)

**Items that were used**
* Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+
* Arduino Nano 
* Four Male to Female Jumper wires
* Four Male to Male Jumper wires
* Logic Level Shifter: Bi-Directional Module (Between 3V3 and 5V)

In order to make the control of the Firing Mechanism possible through communication between the Jetson Nano and the Arduino (shown on above diagram), a communications protocol had to be utilised. Types of communications protocols, such as I2C(Inter-Integrated Circuit), USB(Universal Serial Bus) Serial and SPI(Serial Peripheral Interface) were each investigated to see which would work efficiently when communicating between a Jetson Nano and an Arduino. As a Jetson Nano was not in possession, a Raspberry Pi was instead used to just simulate how certain communications protocols would work with each other.

The first iteration of a communications code between the Arduino and the Raspberry Pi was through USB Serial, in which a USB Cable was required to connect the Arduino straight to the Raspberry Pi. This was a simple type of communication which only required an Arduino USB Cable (dependent on board type) which could freely be moved around due to the length of the cable. However, we  had later anticipated that it would be necessary for a keyboard and mouse USB input to be left available on the Jetson Nano in case of errors. Thus, this idea was scrapped and was moved on to other types of communications protocols.

Other protocols such as I2C and SPI were explored. According to research, when comparing between I2C and SPI, SPI was a faster option; this did not mean it could be instantly utilised though, as not enough examples of communication between an Arduino and a Jetson/Pi could be found online to make use of SPI. Furthermore, it required more wires to be connected to the Nano through a logic level shifter. Due to this, I2C was settled with. 

**Setup**

The Arduino's SDA (Serial Data) was connected to the High Voltage(HV) pin 1, SCL (Serial Clock) at HV2, Arduino 5V at the HV input pin and Arduino Ground to the shifter's Ground. These were connected to the High Voltage due to the Arduino operating at an output of 5V.

The Raspberry Pi's SDA was connected on Low Voltage pin 1, opposite that of the Arduino's SDA connection; SCL was connected to LV2, 3V3 at LV input and Pi Ground to the shifter's ground. The Pi was connected to the Low Voltage side due to the Pi's output voltage being 3V3.

To fully use I2C, the Arduino and the Raspberry Pi's Python 3's libraries were used, being ***wire*** and ***smbus2*** libraries respectively.

## **Project Management** - [Andrew Dean - ad4646d](https://www.github.com/ad4646d) & [Chris Halsall - ch6941r](https://www.github.com/ch6941r)

When the project was announced, we asked all team members to detail their prior skills and experience on a [shared word document](https://github.com/vinthund/UoGACE2022/blob/main/Project%20Management%20Documentation/ELEE1119%20Team%20List%20(AD%20created).docx).

This initial skillset list was used to inform the project specification and division of tasks, which can be found in [this word document](https://github.com/vinthund/UoGACE2022/blob/main/Project%20Management%20Documentation/Project%20Specification%20and%20Division%20of%20Work%20(rev3).docx).

After everyone had agreed to the contents of the specification and the division of work, a [Gantt chart was created in MS Project](https://github.com/vinthund/UoGACE2022/blob/main/Project%20Management%20Documentation/ELEE1119_Project_Plan_7th_Dec_2021.mpp) to give an overview of the project timeline and to clearly communicate deadlines.

After the Gantt was shared with the team, a [KANBAN was maintained within GitHub](https://github.com/vinthund/UoGACE2022/projects/1). This KANBAN would get updated every Tuesday during the weekly standup meeting to establish what tasks people had in-progress and what tasks they had outstanding.
