/* I2C Communication Code
    Tested between Arduino and its Master, (Currently Raspberry Pi).
    Communication contents will consist of status codes to update the Raspberry Pi of its current status, and vice versa.
    SDA <--> SDA
    SCL <--> SCL
    GND <--> GND

    Version 2.3.2
   Changes made:
     * Addition of ammo checking condition that checks if ammo is within container. If there is, it triggers the shoot flag, thereby shooting the target with foam.
     * Changes made to servo definitions to make them on the same line, making code look cleaner.

/* The below function handles target detection.
 * It first maps the values from 0 to 1023(current limit) to 0 to 180. This is done due the servo being limited at ~180 degrees.
 * While it is true that it could instead be done from -90 to 90, doing this does not work, as it limits the servo for some reason into just 90 degrees.
 * The conditional statement within the function first checks if movement is true. As you remember, movement was the flag within the 
 * statusCodes function to check if the values being received were the same or were different. If they were different, it would set "movement" to true.
 * Thus, the below statement checks if this flag is true, then writes on to both servo "x" and "y" the values that were sent over I2C. 
 * After it has finished writing the values, it sets movement to false to block any further movements.
